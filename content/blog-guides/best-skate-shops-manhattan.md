Manhattan is where NYC skateboarding was born. From the banks at Brooklyn Bridge to the plazas of Midtown, this borough's streets shaped the sport. These three shops — spanning Downtown to Harlem — keep the tradition alive.

## 🏆 1. Labor Skateboard Shop — Lower East Side

**Address:** 46 Canal St, New York, NY 10002

Labor is a cornerstone. Sitting on Canal Street for over two decades, it's been the meeting point for downtown skaters since day one. The shop has an old-school soul — no gimmicks, just quality decks, hardware, and a deep connection to the local scene. If you've seen any NYC skate video in the last 20 years, someone in it probably came through Labor.

**What to know:** Small shop, curated selection. They carry local brands you won't find at chain stores. The staff knows every spot within a 20-block radius.

**Best for:** Downtown skaters and anyone who respects the roots.

## 🏆 2. Uncle Funky's Boards — Greenwich Village

**Address:** 338 6th Ave, New York, NY 10014

Uncle Funky's is the Village's skate institution. Known for patient, welcoming staff and an incredible longboard selection, it's the shop that turns tourists into riders and beginners into regulars. The vibe is chill — no attitude, just boards.

**What to know:** Best beginner experience in Manhattan. They'll size you up, explain the options, and get you rolling without any pressure. Great longboard and cruiser selection.

**Best for:** Beginners, longboarders, and anyone who appreciates good vibes.

## 🏆 3. Uptown Riders — Harlem

**Address:** 2144 Frederick Douglass Blvd, New York, NY 10026

Uptown Riders brought skateboarding to Harlem in a real way. More than just a shop, it's a community hub — hosting events, workshops, and sessions that give uptown kids a space to ride. Full selection of decks, wheels, and trucks, plus a welcoming atmosphere that makes you want to come back.

**What to know:** If you're above 96th Street, this is your spot. Regular community events and a crew that rides together.

**Best for:** Uptown skaters and anyone who wants to see skateboarding grow.

## Tips for Visiting Manhattan Skate Shops

- **Combine with a skate.** LES Park, Tompkins Square, and the Chelsea Piers area are all session-worthy and near these shops.
- **Subway is king.** The 6 to Canal for Labor, the A/C/E to West 4th for Uncle Funky's, and the B/C to 116th for Uptown Riders.
- **Go with a plan.** Manhattan shops tend to be compact — they stock what matters, not filler.
- **Ask the staff.** These are skaters who ride the city daily. They know where to go, what's skateable, and what to avoid.

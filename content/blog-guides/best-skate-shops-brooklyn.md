Brooklyn's skate scene is one of the most vibrant in the country. From DIY spots under the BQE to packed sessions at LES Coleman, Brooklyn riders have built a culture that's raw, creative, and unapologetically itself. Here are the shops keeping that energy alive.

## 🏆 1. Homage Brooklyn — Bushwick

**Address:** 5 Knickerbocker Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237

Homage is more than a skate shop — it's Bushwick's living room for board culture. Walk in and you'll find quality decks and wheels alongside art shows, video premieres, and community events. The vibe is inclusive and underground, attracting everyone from seasoned street skaters to curious beginners drawn in by the storefront art.

**What to know:** Great selection of decks and streetwear. Check their Instagram for event listings — their video nights are legendary.

**Best for:** Riders who want community with their gear.

**Formerly:** Brooklyn storefront (Bushwick)

KCDC has been a Brooklyn institution since 2001 — over 23 years of building one of the most inclusive skate communities in the city. While they've moved to an online-only model, their Brooklyn DNA runs deep. They've always been a safe space for everyone, regardless of skill level, gender, or background.

**What to know:** Shop online at their site for decks, shoes, and apparel. They still run community events and pop-ups around Brooklyn.

**Best for:** Supporting an OG Brooklyn brand with a mission.

## 🏆 3. Bustin Boards — Williamsburg

**Address:** 11 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY 11249

If you ride longboards, you already know Bustin. With 23 years of building history, they've defined what it means to skate everything — from downhill bombing to daily push commutes. Their Williamsburg HQ is a destination for riders from around the world looking for the Shrike, Maestro, and Sportster lines.

**What to know:** This is longboard central. If you're looking for a street deck, hit Homage or KCDC. But if you want the best longboard shop in NYC? This is it.

**Best for:** Longboarders, commuters, and anyone who wants to push.

## Tips for Visiting Brooklyn Skate Shops

- **Get there by train.** The L and M lines hit Bushwick; the J/M/Z get you to Williamsburg. Skip driving.
- **Combine with a session.** Brooklyn has incredible street spots and parks — McCarren, Cooper Park, and the Bushwick DIY scene are all nearby.
- **Support local.** These shops survive on community support. Buy a deck, grab some hardware, or just say what's up.
- **Check hours.** Smaller shops keep irregular hours. Instagram is usually the most up-to-date source.
